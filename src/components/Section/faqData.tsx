					DIVA Protocol
					</a> is a highly flexible and universal blockchain based operating system
					to create and settle derivative products.					
					DIVA Donate is utilizing DIVA Protocol to manage 
					the donations and their release in a programmatic and predictibale manner, eliminating the need for trusted centralized intermediaries.

		title: 'What are conditional donations?',
		body: (
			<>
					Conditional donations differ from direct donations in that they come with 
					certain conditions attached. These conditions specify under which circumstances 
					funds will be released to the recipient. For example, a donation may be 
					conditioned on the rain amount over a certain period of time in a given 
					area. If it falls below a predefined level that is associated with drought, 
					the donation will be triggered to financially support the people affected. 
					If it stays above that level, no donation will be triggered. Conditional donations
					are comparable to insurance with the difference that former is free of charge for the recipient.

		title: 'What are the benefits of conditional donations?',
		body: (
			<>
				Conditional donations can provide a number of benefits compared to direct donations:
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				<ul>
					<li> > <b>Greater control:</b> Because the terms of the donation are specified upfront, donors can ensure that 
					their funds are used in a way that aligns with their values and priorities. This can be particularly 
					useful for donors who want to support specific causes or who have specific goals in mind for their donation.</li>
					<li> > <b>Based on need:</b> Conditional donations are only released if recipientâ€™s are in actual need. This 
					can help to ensure that the funds are used in the most effective way possible and can help to 
					maximize the positive impact of the donation.</li>
					<li> > <b>Greater impact:</b> Unused funds can be redeployed into new conditional donation campaigns, thereby 
					maximizing the impact and reach of the donation.</li>
					<li> > <b>Verifiable:</b> The underlying trigger events are publicly verifiable and the release of the donation 
					is detached from any potential external bias.</li>
				</ul>

		title: 'How does it work?',
		body: (
			<>
				Donors can contribute funds to DIVA Protocol in the form of digital stablecoins such as USDT or USDC. 
				Once the funds are deposited, they are held in a programmatic escrow, and beneficiaries are issued 
				tokenized contingent claims. At the end of the campaign, the data provider Shamba Network reports to 
				the DIVA smart contract, which determines the payout based on the specific campaign's payoff profile. 
				Beneficiaries can then claim their share of the donation by returning their contingent claim. Donors 
				can redeem any unused funds and redeploy them into a new conditional donation campaign.
				The process is fully automated and doesn't involve any central intermediary to custody and manage the funds.

				To leverage the full power of the blockchain technology, there is a one-time setup process that users will have 
				to go through. This involves the following steps:
				
				<ul>
					<li> > <b>Install Metamask:</b> Metamask is your wallet that will hold your assets and that you will use to initiate transactions on the blockchain. 
					You can download the Chrome browser extension <a
					href='https://metamask.io/'
					className='underline mx-1'
					target={'_blank'} rel="noreferrer">
					here
				</a>.</li>
					<li> > <b>Get MATIC:</b> Transacting on the blockchain requires the payment of a small fee amount. As DIVA Donate is running on Polygon, the fee amount
					is paid in the native MATIC token. Reach out to us and we will send you a bit to save you this step. </li>
					<li> > <b>Fund your wallet:</b> To participate as a donor in campaigns, you will require a stablecoin such as USDT or USDC. </li>
