					Conditional donations differ from direct donations in that they come with 
					certain conditions attached. These conditions specify under which circumstances 
					funds will be released to the recipient. For example, a donation may be 
					conditioned on the rain amount over a certain period of time in a given 
					area. If it falls below a predefined level that is associated with drought, 
					the donation will be triggered to financially support the people affected. 
					If it stays above that level, no donation will be triggered. Conditional donations
					is comparable to an insurance that doesn't require the recipient to pay a premium.

				Conditional donations can provide a number of benefits compared to direct donations:
				<ul>
					<li> > <b>Greater control:</b> Because the terms of the donation are specified upfront, donors can ensure that 
					their funds are used in a way that aligns with their values and priorities. This can be particularly 
					useful for donors who want to support specific causes or who have specific goals in mind for their donation.</li>
					<li> > <b>Based on need:</b> Conditional donations are only released if recipientâ€™s are in actual need. This 
					can help to ensure that the funds are used in the most effective way possible and can help to 
					maximize the positive impact of the donation.</li>
					<li> > <b>Greater impact:</b> Unused funds can be redeployed into new conditional donation campaigns, thereby 
					maximizing the impact and reach of the donation.</li>
					<li> > <b>Verifiable:</b> The underlying trigger events are publicly verifiable and the release of the donation 
					is detached from any potential external bias.</li>

		body: (
			<>
				The DIVA smart contract manages the full conditional donation cycle in a trustless 
				and predictable manner. It allows donors to deposit funds (e.g., in 
				the form of stablecoins such as USDT or other digital assets) and issue tokenized 
				contingent claims to beneficiaries, data providers to report event outcomes 
				and beneficiaries to claim their share in the donation after the outcome has been 
				reported and the payout has been determined by the DIVA smart contract. Any 
				unused funds can be claimed by the donor and redeployed into a new conditional donation campaign.
